First impression conclusion - legacy library for legacy protocol with its pros. and cons. Pros. Open source; Should be stable and well tested; Decent documentation: Decent community; Maven based. Cons: No Java 8 support; Latest Spring Framework support is questionable; Support in general is a grey area. Well, let’s take next step. Looked really promising.

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>We are starting a new project in Healthcare integration domain. The core functionality can be described like “a service/application which accepts HL7v2 messages over HTTP, validates them, transforms into custom XML and delivers to the recipients via SFTP”. When I googled for “HL7v2 Java” - HAPI is the first thing which tops the results. What does it mean? Let’s start with some definitions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7">HL7</a> stands for “Health Level 7”. It’s a standard which describes how to transfer different healthcare clinical data.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Level_7#HL7_version_2">HL7v2</a> is a version of HL7 standard developed in 1989 and it is based on pipes <code class="highlighter-rouge">|</code> and carets <code class="highlighter-rouge">^</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/">HAPI</a> is a Java-based Hl7v2 parser library.</li>
</ul>

<p>When I first heard about HL7v2 several years ago and reviewed HL7v2 messages it looked like a bad joke. Neither XML nor JSON, really? Well, 1989 - what else you can expect. On the other side the protocol is widely adopted and currently it is still the main workhorse in healthcare industry.</p>

<p>First results of checking HAPI website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The latest stable version is 2.2 and the last published date is “2014-05-12”;</li>
  <li>The site is hosted at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/">sourceforge.net</a>;</li>
  <li>The library is built by <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>;</li>
  <li>Lots of examples in <a href="http://hl7api.sourceforge.net/devbyexample.html">Developing using HAPI - By Example</a> section;</li>
  <li>Decently looking Documentation section with references to all HL7v2.1 - HL7v2.6 messages.</li>
</ul>

<p>First impression conclusion - legacy library for legacy protocol with its pros. and cons.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open source;</li>
  <li>Should be stable and well tested;</li>
  <li>Decent documentation:</li>
  <li>Decent community;</li>
  <li>Maven based.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No Java 8 support;</li>
  <li>Latest Spring Framework support is questionable;</li>
  <li>Support in general is a grey area.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well, let’s take next step.</p>

<p>Looked really promising.</p>
